## Usage/Experience:
  After installing and configuring `spotibar` to run on your status bar as
described below, you should see the currently playing track/artist, interactive
controls to go to the previous song, play/pause and go to the next track. The
thing that justifies the little bit of extra work to set up this module is in
the final icon, options/playlists. If you right click on this option, you will
get a config option popup which lets you enable/disable adding tracks you like
to a Spotify playlist, hearting the track on last.fm, the different display
options, etc. It will also allow you to select multiple playlists to add to at
once, and other options. Clicking it will trigger all liking/adding to playlist
options.

## Installation:
  Installation is in three steps, the first is getting credentials from [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications). You need to create an app (call it whatever you like) to find your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, and you need to `Edit Settings`, and set the `Redirect URIs` to `http://127.0.0.1`.

  Secondly, you need to install `spotibar` and run it's `init` processes:
```
pipx install spotibar
spotibar --init
```

  During this install process, you will be directed to open a browser to allow Spotibar interact with your Spotify account. After accepting this, you will be redirected to a URL beginning with `http://127.0.0.1`. Copy this whole URL and paste it back into the init process when asked!

  If you're getting errors, try removing spotibar and reinstalling under sudo permissions. If you get an error involving `libtk8.6.so`, install tk using your distro's package manager.

  Once `spotibar` is installed and authenticated, you need to modify your status bar config as follows (or however suits your needs!):

### Polybar:
```
modules-right = <other modules> spotibar-currently-playing spotibar-previous-track spotibar-toggle-playback spotibar-next-track spotibar-add-to-playlist <other modules>

[module/spotibar-previous-track]
type = custom/script
exec = echo ""
click-left = spotibar --previous-track
exec-if = [ $(spotibar --is-live) = "True" ]
format-underline = #1db954
format-padding = 2

[module/spotibar-next-track]
type = custom/script
exec = echo ""
click-left = spotibar --next-track
exec-if = [ $(spotibar --is-live) = "True" ]
format-underline = #1db954
format-padding = 2

[module/spotibar-toggle-playback]
type = custom/script
exec = echo " "
click-left = spotibar --toggle-playback
exec-if = "pgrep spotify"
format-underline = #1db954
format-padding = 2

[module/spotibar-currently-playing]
type = custom/script
exec = spotibar --get-currently-playing
click-left = i3-msg '[class="Spotify"] focus'
exec-if = [ $(spotibar --is-live) = "True" ]
format-underline = #1db954
format-padding = 2

[module/spotibar-add-to-playlist]
type = custom/script
exec = echo "≣"
click-left = spotibar --add-track-to-monthly-playlist
click-right = spotibar --config-popup
exec-if = [ $(spotibar --is-live) = "True" ]
format-underline = #1db954
format-padding = 2
```

### Waybar:
Note that this relies on `mediaplayer.py` to output the currently playing track. This behaviour can easily be modified (e.g. by using `spotibar --get-currently-playing`)

```
"modules-center": ["custom/media", "custom/media-skip-backward", "custom/media-play-pause", "custom/media-skip-forward"],

"custom/media": {
  "format": "{icon}   {}",
  "return-type": "json",
  "max-length": 40,
  "format-icons": {
    "spotify": "",
    "default": "🎜"
  },
  "escape": true,
  "exec": "$HOME/.config/waybar/mediaplayer.py 2> /dev/null",
  "on-click-right": "spotibar --add-track-to-monthly-playlist"
},

"custom/media-play-pause": {
  "format": "<span size='20pt'>\udb81\udc0e</span>",
  "on-click": "playerctl play-pause",
},
"custom/media-skip-backward": {
  "format": "<span size='20pt'>\udb81\udcab</span>",
  "on-click": "playerctl previous",
},
"custom/media-skip-forward": {
  "format": "<span size='20pt'>\udb81\udcac</span>",
  "on-click": "playerctl next",
},

```

You should also modify your `~/.config/waybar/styles.css` to style the buttons added above. e.g.

```
#custom-media-skip-backward,
#custom-media-play-pause,
#custom-media-skip-forward {
    padding: 0 6px;
    color: #ffffff;
}
```

  Done! Enjoy! File (probably inevitable) bug reports as issues!

## Development:
  Create an issue if you have any bug reports/feature requests/want to add a feature and are looking for help with the environment setup.
